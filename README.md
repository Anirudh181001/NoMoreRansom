Disclaimer: I do not own any of the tools available here. This is just to help those people out there who need a quick solution to ransomware file decryption.

All credit goes to the 'No More Ransom' project at https://www.nomoreransom.org/en/decryption-tools.html (more information and how-to guides are available there).

Other tools not found in the aforementioned page were discovered from various other reliable online sources (such as Avast, Bitdefender and Emsisoft).
